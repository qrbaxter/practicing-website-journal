          <h2>My Exciting New Journey in Frontend Development</h2>
          <p>Why did I want to become a frontend developer, you might ask? Because its the perfect recluse job you can do from home. Now, I'm not an antisocial person at all. Im very extroverted and love talking to people. But the last few years, especially after the pandemic, really made me realise how much I just like to sit at home with my dog, which is something I'm so excited about as an eventuality of hopefully becoming a web developer.</p>

          <h3>Frontend Development as a Career</h3>
          <p>Frontend Development is simply the development side of everything associated with what the user sees and interacts with in the application or program being built. Kind of like the front end of the store. The customers see and interact with and purchase the products, but don't see the manufacturing or packing or hidden processes in the backend, hidden away from the customer view. Frontend development is all about making stuff pretty for people, and I'm super passionate about everything aesthetic there is.</p>

          <h3>How I Build These Projects.</h3>
          <p>I build these projects by utilising Scrimba, Google and Stack Overflow to aid me in learning various representational techniques using Javascript, HTML and CSS. Scrimba is a fantastic training resource and has probably the best educational training system I've ever seen in a computer science training course. The instructors are amazing, and so is the material and accessibility of training and learning.  </p>

        <p>A recreation of Twitter, with near full functionality including posting new tweets. This was fun to make, and helps me realise the potential for what is out there to create, an endless world of possibilities. </p>

        <h2 class="blog-title">Instagram Clone</h2>
        <p>I made a quick and snappy Instagram clone page just for fun, to see how quickly I could reproduce it. Full functionality has not been added but it is something I will do in the future once I am more experienced. </p>

        <h2 class="blog-title">Visit Melbourne</h2>
        <p>A page I built in the Scrimba program, about visitng my current city of residence, Melbourne, in Australia. It's a wonderful city with a lot to offer, and a very good standard of living and quality of life in general. Nice parks, nice places to go, and you don't even need nice people when you can just spend all of your time in beautiful nature places with your dog.</p>
