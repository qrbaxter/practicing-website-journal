        <h2 class="title">My experiences as a Web Dev student.</h2>
        <p>In a few weeks of Web Development, I have built a variety of different projects, and learned a variety of different pieces of the enormous and exciting toolkit that the field of Web Development has to offer. Here are some of the projects I've built. </p>

        <h2 class="blog-title">Restaurant Order App</h2>
        <p>One of the Scrimba course projects, the Restaurant Order app. It was a challenge figuring out all the logic, but I got there in the end with the help of my old pals Google and Stack Overflow! haha.</p>

        <h2 class="blog-title">Beautiful People</h2>
        <p>I have a love for beauty and aesthetics, and beautiful people are one part of that. Hence I made a simple page just for fun to showcase some aesthetic individuals. Beauty is an incredible power in modern day living, I find it fascinating and engrossing as an intellectual, emotional and spiritual topic to discuss.</p>

        <h2 class="blog-title">TheFalseProfessional</h2>
        <p>This was a simple page I made as a snippet to my youtube channel. I know youtube is a very competitive space, and I dont yet know what I can do to stand out from the crowd, but I am trying different things, and just having fun with it.</p>

        <h2 class="blog-title">Blitter App</h2>
        <p>A recreation of Twitter, with near full functionality including posting new tweets. This was fun to make, and helps me realise the potential for what is out there to create, an endless world of possibilities. </p>

        <h2 class="blog-title">Instagram Clone</h2>
        <p>I made a quick and snappy Instagram clone page just for fun, to see how quickly I could reproduce it. Full functionality has not been added but it is something I will do in the future once I am more experienced. </p>

        <h2 class="blog-title">Visit Melbourne</h2>
        <p>A page I built in the Scrimba program, about visitng my current city of residence, Melbourne, in Australia. It's a wonderful city with a lot to offer, and a very good standard of living and quality of life in general. Nice parks, nice places to go, and you don't even need nice people when you can just spend all of your time in beautiful nature places with your dog.</p>
