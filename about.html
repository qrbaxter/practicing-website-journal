            <h2>Hi there! My name Alex, this is my journal.</h2>
            <p>After two months of learning in the Frontend development, I've decided to share my journey and how it has been so far to those who want join this field of software development.</p>

          <h3>How I stay committed to learning</h3>
          <p>I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I've spent and am still spending hours and hours learning, then trying to create simple projects using what I learned or working new techniques into existing projects. While this is fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning with the world.</p>

          <p>What fuels my learning is the realisation that nothing in life really matters except survival and progress. And the best way to progress is to learn, so that is what I've set my mind on doing. Learning, progressing and improving.</p>

          <h3>How I got started</h3>
          <p> Really, I got started by simply realising I am a very happy indoor cat and nothing makes me happier than the prospect of working as a solitary web developer, hidden away from the world with a dog and my computer. I don't need to go faraway places to be happy. Just trips to nature, forests and the like with my dog is all I need. But I do like snowboarding. Snowboarding is great too. </p>

        <p>One of the Scrimba course projects, the Restaurant Order app. It was a challenge figuring out all the logic, but I got there in the end with the help of my old pals Google and Stack Overflow! haha.</p>

        <h2 class="blog-title">Beautiful People</h2>
        <p>I have a love for beauty and aesthetics, and beautiful people are one part of that. Hence I made a simple page just for fun to showcase some aesthetic individuals. Beauty is an incredible power in modern day living, I find it fascinating and engrossing as an intellectual, emotional and spiritual topic to discuss.</p>

        <p>This was a simple page I made as a snippet to my youtube channel. I know youtube is a very competitive space, and I dont yet know what I can do to stand out from the crowd, but I am trying different things, and just having fun with it.</p>
